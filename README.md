## Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for your OS.

## Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for your OS. 

## Checkout this repo. Please notice that, if your OS is Windows, then you need to have at least version 10 (otherwise Docker can raise some exceptions); moreover ,before doing the checkout, please be sure to run the following git command:
  ```
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  ```
  This command avoids the EOL (End Of Line) replacement. The latter is due to git which automatically reformat the file based on the current OS. As a conseguence, Linux-style EOL are replaced with Windows-style EOL.

## Enter the Terminal or the Command Prompt at root level of the project

## Run `docker-compose up` to first build and then run the project (it tooks several minutes the first time you run the command).
